	<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Having completed a few programming courses as part of my Web Application Development program, I was trying to think of a project to 
	work on that would enable me to practise my coding skills.  Having just entered my Winter Break, and with a lot of spare time, I thought
	to myself, why not find and work on a programming project?</p>
	<p>I had thought about a website I could make, but also wanted something where I could also input my newly found javascript/jQuery skills
	into.  And since I work in the Game and Hobby industry, why not choose a Trading Card Game to make.  I mean, how hard could it be right?</p>
	<p>Well, turns out that it is a lot harder that I think it should be, with having to think about the coding for moving the cards around, 
	deciding when a card can attack or block, how to implement effects such as Spells in a game of Magic: The Gathering, or adding energy to 
	a card such as Pokemon.  This was beginning to sound like an audacious project.</p>
	<p>But if we don't try, we won't know if something is impossible, and thus I decided to give it a try.  The game I decided to choose was a 
	Trading Card Game called Force of Will.</p>
	<p>Now Force of Will doesn't have an official online game (there was one in the works up until late 2016 when Force of Will pulled the plug
	on that project), and since the only ways to play Force of Will at the moment online is via UnTap.In or Lackey, I thought to myself, "Hey,
	if they can do it, why can't I?"  In addition, the added benefit I could implement would be that my version of this TCG would be solely for
	Force of Will.</p>
