		<h1 class="title-content">Terminology</h1>
		<br>
		<div class="text-background-light">
			<h2 id="c">Coinsurance</h2>
			<p>This is a cost YOU pay.  It is percentage based.  It covers a percentage cost of a healthcare service AFTER you have paid your deductible.</p>
			<br>
		</div>
		<div class="text-background-dark">
			<h2>Copayment (Copay)</h2>
			<p>This is a cost YOU pay to a healthcare provider at the time you receive services. You may have to pay a copay for each covered visit to your doctor, 
			depending on your plan. Not all plans have a copay.</p>
			<br>
		</div>
		<div class="text-background-light">
			<h2 id="d">Deductible</h2>
			<p>This is a cost YOU pay.  This is the amount you pay your healthcare services, and once you pay out this amount your health insurer pays 
			begins to pay.  Deductibles are based on your benefit period (typically a year at a time).</p>
			<br>
			<em>Example: If your plan has a $2,000 annual deductible, you will be expected to pay the first $2,000 toward your healthcare services. 
			After you reach $2,000, your health insurer will cover some or all of the costs.</em>
		</div>
		<div class="text-background-dark">
			<h2 id="f">FSA (Flexible Spending Account)</h2>
			<p>An FSA is often set up through an employer plan. It lets you set aside pre-tax money for common medical costs and dependent care. 
			FSA funds must be used by the end of the term-year. It will be sent back to the employer if you don't use it. 
			Check with your employer's Human Resources team. They can provide a list of FSA-qualified costs that you can purchase directly or be reimbursed for. 
			A few common FSA-qualified costs include:</p>
			<br>
			<ul class="list-circles">
				<li>Copays for doctors’ visits</li>
				<li>Chiropractor and psychological sessions</li>
				<li>Medical tests and services (like X-rays and screenings)</li>
				<li>Hospital fees</li>
				<li>Physical rehabilitation</li>
				<li>Dental and orthodontic expenses (like cleaning, fillings and braces)</li>
				<li>Inpatient treatment for alcohol or drug addiction</li>
				<li>Vaccines (immunizations) and flu shots</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="text-background-light">
			<h2 id="n">Network Provider/In-network Provider</h2>
			<p>A healthcare provider who is part of a plan’s network.</p>
			<br>
		</div>
		<div class="text-background-dark">
			<h2 id="o">Out-of-pocket Cost</h2>
			<p>This is a cost you MUST pay. Out-of-pocket costs vary by plan and each plan has a maximum out of pocket (MOOP) cost. </p>
			<br>
		</div>
		<div class="text-background-light">
			<h2 id="p">PPO (Preferred Provider Organization)</h2>
			<p>A type of insurance plan that offers more extensive coverage for the services of healthcare providers who are part of 
			the plan's network, but still offers some coverage for providers who are not part of the plan's network. PPO plans generally 
			offer more flexibility than HMO plans, but premiums tend to be higher.</p>
			<br>
		</div>
		<div class="text-background-dark">
			<h2>Premium</h2>
			<p>This is a cost YOU pay.  Payments you make to your insurance provider to keep your coverage. The payments are due at certain times. </p>
