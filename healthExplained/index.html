		<p>This website is designed to provide anyone residing in the USA with information about healthcare insurance.  On this website, you'll find a terminology section that will explain
		health insurance terms and lingo so that it can better help your understand of the insurance you obtain.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The website will also provide you with information about health insurance providers and some of the latest news regarding health insurance in the Washington State area.</p>

		<h1><img class="image-float-left" src="images/doctorPointingNotes.jpg" alt="hand of a doctor pointing at some health chart">Who is this site for?</h1>
		<p>The website is for anyone to view.  Anyone and everyone who has, or is looking to obtain healthcare insurance will find some of the information here useful for their needs.  As more information
		 is obtained, the hope is for this website to help everyone have a better understanding of healthcare and to be aware of their rights and when false healthcare claims are made by health organisations,
		 until universal healthcare becomes a reality for all in America.</p>
